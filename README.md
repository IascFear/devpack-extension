</div>

DevPack is a collection of high-quality resources that you can use in your projects. Here you will find icons, images, videos, illustrations, fonts and more. You can contribute to this project by suggesting new resources or making a pull request.

> **Note:** We deploy the latest update of the extension every Sunday, so you can expect new resources every week.
